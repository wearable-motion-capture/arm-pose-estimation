# Arm Pose Estimaton Module

This repository is part of the [wearable motion capture](https://github.com/wearable-motion-capture) framework and 
provides code to estimate the arm pose from smartwatch and smartphone sensor data. It opens network sockets to receive 
sensor data from our smartwatch and phone apps. You can then either record the arm poses into a `csv` file, or stream them to our [arm-pose-visualization](https://github.com/wearable-motion-capture/arm-pose-visualization) project for a real-time visualization.
